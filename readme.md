# KRnD: Kerbal Research & Development

## Introduction

*Kerbal Research & Development* (or KRnD) is a mod for [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com), which aims at giving the player a more interesting end-game experience. With this mod you can spend science-points to improve the stats of unlocked parts such as the mass or engine-efficiency, giving you a good reason to bring back every single last bit of science from your deep-space missions that you can.
